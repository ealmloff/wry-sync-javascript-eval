# Wry bindgen
I am developing a replacement for wasm bindgen in the wry-bindgen folder. Status:
- [x] Minimal features in web-sys compiling with the new bindgen
- [x] Web-sys compiling with --all-features
  - [x] Support for Clamped type
  - [x] Support for Option<Vec<T>>
- [x] Js-sys compiling with the new bindgen
- [x] Basic roundtrip tests passing
- [x] Casting and type checking
- [x] Don't hardcode drop and clone implementations - use the macro

## Project structure
The wry-bindgen project is structured as follows:
- `wry-bindgen`: The core crate that handles types for calls into and from the wry webview.
- `wry-bindgen-macro`: The procedural macro crate that generates the bindings.
- `wasm-bindgen`: A submodule which contains the original wasm-bindgen code for reference. THIS MAY NEVER BE MODIFIED.

## Requirements
- Tests are in the `/tests` folder. Any new behavior should be covered by tests.
- No `js` files should be modified manually. All `js` files are autogenerated from `ts` files in the build.rs
